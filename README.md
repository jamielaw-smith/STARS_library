# STARS_library

STARS: stellar TDEs (tidal disruption events) with abundances and realistic structures

## Description

STARS_library is a grid of fallback rates to the black hole (dM/dt) from 3D hydrodynamical simulations of tidal disruption events (TDEs) using realistic stellar models. Possible use cases are:

(1) One can download the original dM/dt's from Law-Smith+2020a here (note these also exist in the `input/` folder of this repository): https://www.dropbox.com/s/pissnvep1389s9t/STARS_library_input.zip?dl=0.

(2) One can create an interpolated library of dM/dt's from these simulations, to arbitrary spacing in stellar mass, stellar age, and impact parameter. 

Several pre-packaged interpolated grids with different spacings are also available.

NUM_BETA=10, NUM_MASS=5, NUM_AGE=5: https://www.dropbox.com/s/xohdcp5tylazsrg/STARS_library_output_10_5_5.zip?dl=0 (80 MB)

NUM_BETA=100, NUM_MASS=2, NUM_AGE=2: https://www.dropbox.com/s/l43ey32hgyqszjl/STARS_library_output_1000_2_2.zip?dl=0 (0.9 GB)

NUM_BETA=100, NUM_MASS=12, NUM_AGE=12: LINK (5 GB)

(3) One can retrieve dM/dt's for any particular values of (stellar mass, stellar age, impact parameter), either at the command line or via a list in a file.


## Installation

`git clone https://github.com/jamielaw-smith/STARS_library.git`

## Setup

`cd STARS_library`

Do either this, to install requirements through anaconda:

`conda env create -f environment.yml`

`conda activate stars_lib`

Or, to install requiements via pip:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`


## Usage

### Initialize interpolated library:

`python STARS_Library.py`

This creates an interpolated library in `output/`. 
The input and output directories and the parameters of the interpolation are set in `STARS.config`:

`input_dir` sets the input directory, AKA the backbone of simulated models.

`output_dir` sets the output directory, AKA where the interpolated library is output.

`NUM_BETA_INTERP_POINTS` sets the total number of betaâ€™s for each stellar mass and age.

`NUM_MASS_INTERP_POINTS` sets the number of stellar masses in between each input mass.

`NUM_AGE_INTERP_POINTS` set the number of stellar ages in between each input age.

### Retrieve a single dM/dt:

`python STARS_Library.py -r 1.0 0.0 2.0`

This retrieves a dM/dt for a star with 

mass=1.0 [M_sun],

age=0.0 [fractional; 0 == ZAMS, 1.0 == TAMS], 

beta=2.0 [impact parameter].

This command line option is appropriate for retrieving a single interpolated model at a time. Results will be placed in `retrieval/` by default. This can be customized in `STARS.config`:

`retrieval_input_dir` sets the directory the retrieval code looks for its backbone, AKA the interpolated library.

`retrieval_scratch_dir` sets the temporary scratch directory the retrieval creates and then deletes in its execution.

`retrieval_output_dir` sets the directory the retrieval outputs to.

### Retrieve a list of dM/dt's:

`python STARS_Library.py -g`

This retrieves a list of dM/dt's from `RETRIEVE.par`.

One can specify a list of stellar masses, age, and impact parameters for which to retrieve dM/dt's in `RETRIEVE.par`, either tab- or comma-separated. The name of this file can be customized in `STARS.config`:

`retrieval_grid_file` sets the parameter file read for `-g`.

## Notes

If you use the `-r` or `-g` options and the interpolated library in `output/` has not been initialized yet, the code will do this automatically.

Errors will be thrown if you request a dM/dt from a stellar mass, stellar age, or impact parameter outside the range of the interpolated library. Stellar mass is in the range [0.3,3] M_sun, stellar age [0.0, 1.0] fractional MS age, and impact parameter has a particular range for each star. The allowed range for beta is a little trickier to guess a priori, but the code will tell you what the range for a given star is if it throws an error.

If you are renaming the default output directory, make sure that output directory (`output/` by default) is completely empty on the first initialize.
